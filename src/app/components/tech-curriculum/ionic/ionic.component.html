    <h1>What is Ionic?</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Ionic is an HTML5 mobile app development framework targeted at building hybrid mobile apps. Hybrid apps are essentially
      small websites running in a browser shell in an app that have access to the native platform layer. Hybrid apps have
      many benefits over pure native apps, specifically in terms of platform support, speed of development, and access to
      3rd party code.</p>
